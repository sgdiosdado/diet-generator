# Diet generator

This is a project for Project Management and Evaluation class (TI2011) at Tec de Monterrey.

## Setup
It's important that you've installed Docker, since it's mandatory to run the environment.

Clone the repo, `cd` into the project and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
This will build the image and start the server.

Check your `http://localhost:8000/` and if you see something, you're good to go.

### Note:
Ask the owner for the secret key.
